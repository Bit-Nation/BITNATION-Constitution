# BITNATION-Constitution



This poem was found on the BITNATION forum a few weeks after BITNATION was created. It was posted anonymously. A few minor revisions has been made from the original poem, which we’ve integrated as the moral framework for our constitution. 



We are Ƀitnation.

We are the Birth of a New Virtual Nation.

We are a Future for Our World and Humanity.

We are Sentinels, Universal and Inalienable.

We are Rights and Freedoms.

We are Tolerant and Accepting.

We are Polity and Entity.

We are Privacy and Security.

We are Openness and Transparency.

We are Creativity and Visionary.

We are a Dream and a Reality.

We are Ƀitnation.
