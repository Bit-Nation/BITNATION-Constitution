# BITNATION-Constitution
The constitution is meant to be a general framework that grows organically over time through contributions from citizens.

This poem was found on the BITNATION forum a few weeks after BITNATION was created. It was posted anonymously. A few minor revisions have been made from the original poem, which we've integrated as the framework for our constitution.

These 10 lines (each corresponding to an article) were preserved on the Ethereum blockchain during the creation of our Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN). The articles are intentionally broad because they’ll live forever on the blockchain. However, we can continuously update the interpretation of what the articles mean, and how to implement them. To contribute to the meaning of the article, go to this GitHub repository, and open an issue, or do a pull request.

# Article 1: We are Ƀitnation.

We’re the world’s first Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN), a Blockchain Jurisdiction.

We define a nation the following way:

## 1.1 A Community
A community of likeminded individuals (citizens), working towards a common goal, who’ve become aware of its political autonomy. 

## 1.2 Governance Services
An entity providing opt-in core governance services (rule of law, security) to its citizens, and to non-citizen customers.

## 1.3 Definition of a Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation

- **Decentralized:** Decentralization is the process of redistributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority. In the realm of a DBVN, decentralization translates into both technological and human decentralization - through striving for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) technology, modular interfaces, API (Applications Programming Interface) layers, and forkable (duplicated) code. This means that every user can become its own node and transform the platform to their own liking. Decentralization also benefits from not having any single point of failure in the event of an attack. Human nodes should be able to reorganize themselves in resilient nodes no matter what part of the network comes under attack - be it human or other technological factors. In practice, this means that various clusters, regional or otherwise, are entirely autonomous.

- **Borderless:** DBVN’s do not limit their services to any specific geographical area, ethnicity or other categories of populations. They have no borders or ports of entry: no land boundaries, airports, coastlines, or seaports. DBVN’s provide services to all areas, regardless of where it is located. Some would claim that a DBVN is ‘virtual’ by design. Although virtual-by-design is an intuitive assumption, it does not have to be based entirely in the virtual world, nor its services.

- **Voluntary:** DBVN’s do not use force, fraud, or coercion, nor subject their citizens to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. Due to the fact that DBVN’s are voluntary in nature, they are inherently free of persecution, intimidation, reprisals, and other forms of systematic violence. DBVN’s compete in a free market where customers, the “citizens” of the platform, voluntarily choose which DBVN’s they want to use-- including the option of using several DBVN’s, or none at all, or if they so choose to create their own DBVN.

- **Nation:** A nation is a large group of people who share a common language, culture, ethnicity, descent, or history. In the case of DBVN’s it is likely that people would be as connected through mutual interests and goals as they would more traditional commonalities such as culture and language. A nation is a voluntary formation rather than a governing entity (i.e. a state). We provide the tools for governance but do not impose them, nor do we impose any specific code of law or regulations.”

# Article 2: We are the Birth of a New Virtual Nation.

BITNATION use a model of smart contract based *Liquid Holacracy* based on the philosophy of [Holon](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Holon_(philosophy)), which means *"something that is simultaneously a whole and a part"*, and mimics the way swarm like systems emerge in nature. BITNATION has upgraded the initial implementation of Holocracy into *Liquid* Holocracy, to increase the speed and autonomy of descision making processes, and the agency of individuals and holons.

## 2.1 Core

The core is the lead of the holocracy, a small group of dedicated citizens, who are able to set the general framework, and make swift decisions. Generally the founders and/ or core developers.

A new core can be created at anytime, and the holons and citizens can choose to follow the new core. 

The responsibility of core is to manage the key infrastructure, including funds, wallets, domain names, general political positioning, core development priorities, etc.

Core is the genesis holon of a chain of human operated holons in the DBVN, in the same way a genesis block in a cryptocurrency births the blockchain. 

## 2.2 Holons

Holons are parts within the DBVN, with various degree of autonomy, at various times. Any citizen can start their own holon, for profit or non-for profit, without any central approval. Citizens suggest Holons, and others can choose to finance them or work on them. The holons benefits from the DBVN resources and infrastructure. 

## 2.3 Citizens

Citizens opt in or out on a voluntary basis, and can be part of several nations, or none at all. 

Citizens should contribute in some way, either through work, computing power or in other ways, to the nation. 

Citizens should have read the constitution, and signed off on the principles.

Being a citizen means receiving dividend from the profit of the nation, and being part in building the nation. You do not have to be a citizen to use BITNATION’s services.

Each citizen is subject to the reputation system, which serves as an incentive for good behaviour.

We accept homo sapiens, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) agents as citizens.

## 2.4 Laws

We practice a Polylegal system, meaning people are free to choose the code of law of their preference, whether that’s Common Law, Sharia Law, Civil Law, Pashtunwali, or whatever it may be. People are also free to create new individual laws, or new codes of law. 

Laws can be refereed to, or coded into agreements.

Laws are subject to reputation as well, and people reviewing law are equally subject to reputation of being good or bad at reviewing laws.

All laws compete on a free market, and people can choose which exact law is better suited for each individual agreement.

## 2.5 The Archipelago

The Archipelago is a loose federation of different voluntary nations, allies, embassies, ambassadors who pledge to assist each other when possible, and desirable. 

# Article 3: We are a Future for Our World and Humanity.

We’ll prevent eternal bloodshed through empowering people to compete through offering better governance services, rather than through imposing a one-fit-all governance model through the use of force. We’re creating a precedent for a beautiful universe of millions of entities, one for each preference and desire.

# Article 4: We are Sentinels, Universal and Inalienable.

The imaginary lines in the sand, called borders, belongs to a world of the past, a world of oppressive geographical apartheid. Where we live, there are no nation state borders, only universal freedom of movement.

# Article 5: We are Creativity and Visionary.

In our world, problems are mere obstacles, interesting challenges to be solved through the ingenuity of humans and machines working together. We do not dwell on negativity, rather we work together to find mutually beneficial creative solutions, to be radically innovative.

# Article 6: We are Rights and Freedoms.

We honour the Non-Aggression Principe (NAP) moral framework. We stand unified against any and all forms of coercion, whether it’s through violence, or the implied threat of violence. We’re building a world based on voluntary agreements between consenting entities. 

# Article 7: We are Tolerant and Accepting.

We do not judge or select based on the colour of your skin, ethnicity, religion, country of origin, sexual preference, or degree of post-human. In our DBVN, everyone who wishes to make the world a better place through furthering voluntary agreements, is welcome to be a part of our Nation.

# Article 8: We are Polity and Entity.
   
We have become aware of our political autonomy. We’re no longer willing to be oppressed by the coercive nation-state oligopoly. We live in Cyberspace, and we work together, to achieve freedom and independence. 

# Article 9: We are Privacy and Security.

We will not sell the data of our citizens or customers to any entity, under any circumstances. We strive for client side technology, encryption, and pseudo anonymity. 

# Article 10: We are Openness and Transparency.

Everyone is welcome to join. Everything we do is public.

## Article 10.1 Communications Protocol

**Clarity above all.** Understanding the challenges of communicating across different timezones, culture and personalities both during written and verbal communications. It’s advisable to avoid sweeping statements in favor of clearly articulated sentences with well defined purposes. 

**Refrain from jumping to conclusions** A fundamental problem in many conversations is that we overestimate others capacity to understand our written and verbal communications, and we overestimate our own capacity to understand what they’re trying to communicate. When analyzing what the other person is trying to communicate, take their context into account, including things like timezone, native language, and personal circumstances. 
 
**Respectfulness.** We have come together to change the status quo through creating kickass software, to that end being disrespectful can divert the conversation from our set purpose into irrelevant areas.Personal slights and attacks does not foster a good collaborative space, it s wise to avoid them. When we are emotionally affected by communications, attempt to take a step backwards and swallow the chill pill. Emotional or aggressive responses can disrupt healthy communications and waste valuable time and energy better deployed to achieve the goals of the discussion. 

# Article 11: We are a Dream and a Reality.

# Article 12: We are Ƀitnation.

We are sovereign. We’re together. We’re the future.

### **A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace**


by John Perry Barlow


*Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.*

*We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.*

*Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.*

*You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.*

*You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.*

*Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.*

*We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.*

*We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.*

*Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.*

*Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.*

*In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.*

*You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.*

*In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.*

*Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.*

*These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.*

*We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.*
