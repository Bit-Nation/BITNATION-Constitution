# BITNATION-Constitution



This poem was found on the BITNATION forum a few weeks after BITNATION was created. It was posted anonymously. A few minor revisions has been made from the original poem, which we’ve integrated as the moral framework for our constitution. 



We are Ƀitnation.

We are the Birth of a New Virtual Nation.

We are a Future for Our World and Humanity.

We are Sentinels, Universal and Inalienable.

We are Rights and Freedoms.

We are Tolerant and Accepting.

We are Polity and Entity.

We are Privacy and Security.

We are Openness and Transparency.

We are Creativity and Visionary.

We are a Dream and a Reality.

We are Ƀitnation.

# Article 1: We are Ƀitnation.

We’re the world’s first Decentralized Borderless Virtual Nation (DBVN), a Blockchain Jurisdiction.

We define a nation the following way:

## 1.1 Community 

A community of likeminded individuals (citizens), working towards a common goal, who’ve become aware of its political autonomy. 

## 1.2 Governance Services

An entity providing opt-in core governance services (rule of law, security) to its citizens, and to non-citizen customers.

# Article 2: We are the Birth of a New Virtual Nation.

We use a holocratic governance model, compromised by different entities with various degrees of autonomy: Core, Holons, Citizens, Laws, The Archipelago:

## 2.1 Core

The core is the lead of the holocracy, a small group of dedicated citizens, who are able to set the general framework, and make swift decisions. Generally the founders and/ or core developers.

A new core can be created at anytime, and the holons and citizens can choose to follow the new core. 

The responsibility of core is to manage the key infrastructure, including funds, wallets, domain names, general political positioning, core development priorities, etc.

## 2.2 Holons

Holons are parts within the DBVN, with various degree of autonomy, at various times. Any citizen can start their own holon, for profit or non-for profit, without any central approval. Citizens suggests Holons, and others can choose to finance them or work on them. The holons benefits from the DBVN resources and infrastructure. 

## 2.3 Citizens 

Citizens opt in or out on a voluntary basis, and can be part of several nations, or none at all. 

Citizens should contribute in some way, either through work, computing power or in other ways, to the nation. 

Citizens should have read the constitution, and signed of on the principles.

Being a citizen means receiving dividend from the profit of the nation, and being part in building the nation. You do not have to be a citizen to use BITNATION’s services.

Each citizen is subject to the reputation system, which serves as an incentive for good behaviour.

## 2.4 Laws 

BITNATION practices a Polylegal system, meaning people are free to choose the code of law of their preference, whether that’s Common Law, Sharia Law, Ciwil Law, Pashtunwali, or whatever it may be. People are also free to create new individual laws, or new codes of law. 

Laws can be refereed to, or coded into agreements.

Laws are subject to reputation as well, and people reviewing law are equally subject to reputation of being good or bad at reviewing laws.

All laws compete on a free market, and people can choose which exact law is better suited for each individual agreement.

## 2.5 The Archipelago

The Archipelago is a loose federation of different virtual nations, allies, embassies, ambassadors who pledge to assist each other when possible, and desirable.
