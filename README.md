# BITNATION-Constitution
The constitution is meant to be a general framework that grows organically over time through contributions from citizens.

This poem was found on the BITNATION forum a few weeks after BITNATION was created. It was posted anonymously. A few minor revisions have been made from the original poem, which we've integrated as the framework for our constitution.

These 10 lines (each corresponding to an article) were preserved on the Ethereum blockchain during the creation of our Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN). The articles are intentionally broad because they’ll live forever on the blockchain. However, we can continuously update the interpretation of what the articles mean, and how to implement them.

# Article 1: We are Ƀitnation.

We’re the world’s first Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN), a Blockchain Jurisdiction.

We define a nation the following way:

## 1.1 A Community
A community of likeminded individuals (citizens), working towards a common goal, who’ve become aware of its political autonomy. 

## 1.2 Governance Services
An entity providing opt-in core governance services (rule of law, security) to its citizens, and to non-citizen customers.

## 1.3 Definition of a Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN)

- **Decentralized:** Decentralization is the process of redistributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority. In the realm of a DBVN, decentralization translates into both technological and human decentralization - through striving for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) technology, modular interfaces, API (Applications Programming Interface) layers, and forkable (duplicated) code. This means that every user can become its own node and transform the platform to their own liking. Decentralization also benefits from not having any single point of failure in the event of an attack. Human nodes should be able to reorganize themselves in resilient nodes no matter what part of the network comes under attack - be it human or other technological factors. In practice, this means that various clusters, regional or otherwise, are entirely autonomous.

- **Borderless:** DBVN’s do not limit their services to any specific geographical area, ethnicity or other categories of populations. They have no borders or ports of entry: no land boundaries, airports, coastlines, or seaports. DBVN’s provide services to all areas, regardless of where it is located. Some would claim that a DBVN is ‘virtual’ by design. Although virtual-by-design is an intuitive assumption, it does not have to be based entirely in the virtual world, nor its services.

- **Voluntary:** DBVN’s do not use force, fraud, or coercion, nor subject their citizens to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. Due to the fact that DBVN’s are voluntary in nature, they are inherently free of persecution, intimidation, reprisals, and other forms of systematic violence. DBVN’s compete in a free market where customers, the “citizens” of the platform, voluntarily choose which DBVN’s they want to use-- including the option of using several DBVN’s, or none at all, or if they so choose to create their own DBVN.

- **Nation:** A nation is a large group of people who share a common language, culture, ethnicity, descent, or history. In the case of DBVN’s it is likely that people would be as connected through mutual interests and goals as they would more traditional commonalities such as culture and language. A nation is a voluntary formation rather than a governing entity (i.e. a state). We provide the tools for governance but do not impose them, nor do we impose any specific code of law or regulations.”

# Article 2: We are the Birth of a New Virtual Nation.

BITNATION use a model of smart contract based *Liquid Holacracy* based on the philosophy of [Holon](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Holon_(philosophy)), which means *"something that is simultaneously a whole and a part"*, and mimics the way swarm like systems emerge in nature. BITNATION has upgraded the initial implementation of Holocracy into *Liquid* Holocracy, to increase the speed and autonomy of descision making processes, and the agency of individuals and holons.

The type of *entities* that exist are:

- A Citizen
- A DBVN 
- A Holon
- A Genesis Holon
- Core Contributor
- A Fractal Holon
- Ambassadors
- An Embassy or Consulate
- A Port 

## 2.1 A Citizen
A person (human or AI) who subscribe to the vision, philosophy, rules and goals set out by the DBVN (typically, the constitution of a DBVN) and subscribe to join as a Citizen, to enjoy the services the DBVN offers. 

## 2.2 A DBVN 
A Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (see description under article 1.3)

## 2.3 A Holon
Holons are parts within the DBVN, with various degree of autonomy, at various times. Any citizen can start their own holon, for profit or non-for profit, without any central approval. Citizens suggest Holons, and others can choose to finance them or work on them. The holons benefits from the DBVN resources and infrastructure. 

## 2.4 A Genesis Holon
The first Holon that forms the starting point of a DBVN - a "chain" of human operated holons, in the same way a genesis block in a cryptocurrency births the blockchain. Although membership of the Genesis Holon is subject to change, change is designed to have an inherent slowness worked into it, in order to provide long-term stability and continuity. Members of the Genesis Holon are the ‘Guardians of the DBVN’, essentially. Often synonymous with Core. 

## 2.5 Core Contributors
Citizens who contribute significantly to core functions of the DBVN (like tech, community, finance, etc) at a certain point in time. Typically, the contribution is reflected in the stake of the DBVN multisignature, meaning people who are more intensively involved have a greater say in descisions concerning core infrastructure. 

## 2.6 A Fractal Holon
A person or a small group of person working on a specific project in some degree of proximity to a DBVN or a holon.

## 2.7 Ambassadors
The Ambassador and Embassy networks were conceived as analogue versions of Pangea. A real world network of people and places where digital nomads can get advice, peer-to-peer assistance, meet-up and hang out. There are three types of Bitnation representatives:

 -  Diplomatic Ambassadors: Official Bitnation positions to perform duties as Officers working as our interface with existing Nations, as well as new virtual Nations. 
 -  Diplomatic Consuls: Also an Official position. A support to both our Ambassadors and to Nation State embassies and consulates engaging with our Citizens in the location of our Embassies and Consulates. 
 -  Goodwill Ambassadors: Informal but officially recognised representative of Bitnation during events (such as DEVCONs). Promotes and supports Bitnation and our services and provides a point of contact for our Citizens. 

## 2.8 An Embassy or Consulate
Embassies and Consulates are where Citizens share their space, whether it’s an office, coffee shop or your home, and open it up for fellow citizens, hackers and crypto aficionados around the world! There are two types of places, Embassies and Consulates.

 -  Embassy  A place where you can both live, and work (and naturally, meet).
 -  Consulate A place where you can work – like a shared office space or cafe, for instance – or maybe organise a meetup or a hangout.

## 2.9 A Port 
Administrative entities, such as for-profit or nonprofit entities in different Nation State jurisdictions designed to interact with old world legacy systems such as banks and governments on behalf of BITNATION or other DBVNs

# Article 3: We are a Future for Our World and Humanity.

We will prevent eternal bloodshed through empowering people to compete through offering better governance services, rather than through imposing a one-fit-all governance model through the use of force. We are creating a precedent for a beautiful universe of millions of entities, one for each preference and desire.

State Sovereignty is no longer compatible with our ever more interconnected lives. Governance 1.0 is more often than not the source of grievances, conflicts and war. Increasingly the Nation State oligopoly represents a global geographical apartheid. Ethics aside, State Sovereignty is also impractical. It both fails to adequately address our local needs and our global challenges.  So far the only alternative to State Sovereignty that has been actively explored is multilateral governance, where Nation States pool their sovereignty to minimise competition through institutions such as the United Nations and European Union.  But this model reduces rather than enhances Citizen sovereignty, and therefore the choices they can make about the governance services they receive.

To outcompete Westphalian sovereignty we need to provide a credible alternative to the nation state’s core function - its raison d’etre -  the provision of Security and Jurisdiction. The only way to outcompete nation states is by providing better, more secure, faster, cheaper and peer-to-peer alternatives for these services. In other words, the global Westphalian oligopoly needs competition from decentralised, borderless and voluntary (opt-in) governance services. Through this process the nation state will face death by irrelevance. 

Thus BITNATIONs and Pangea’s Raison D'etre is Jurisdiction as a Service (JaaS). Decentralised arbitration paves the way for humanity to reclaim personal sovereignty and return to peer-to-peer transactions. Pangea increases individual autonomy and enhance collective governance service delivery systems by leveraging existing decentralized encryption tools and technologies.

# Article 4: We are Sentinels, Universal and Inalienable.

## 4.1 We are all born sovereign Citizens of the world, and our personal sovereignty is universal and inalienable. 

Although we refuse to allow any government or individual to take our sovereignty without our consent, nor accept any universal agreement amongst ourselves on how we should, or should not, live our lives, we still seek cooperation with one another. Because we cannot provide for ourselves alone sufficient for a fulfilled and dignified life, we cooperate with others to supply that which we lack or desire when living singly and solely by ourselves. Yet we all remain sovereign, and if our cooperation with others ceases to fulfill that which we lack or desire, we will choose to exit our cooperation and expect no prejudice nor constraint. 

## 4.2 We must all be restrained from invading others personal sovereignty, and from harming one another, to ensure the peace and preservation of all humankind. 

All Citizens are sentinels of our personal sovereignty, and everyone can defend their sovereignty to such a degree as may hinder violation and thereby preserve freedom and restrain tyranny. And if any one of us may defend against another for violating our personal sovereignty, every one of us may also do so: for in a state of universal sovereignty, where there is no jurisdiction of one over another, what anyone may do in protection of their sovereignty, every Citizen must also be free to do.

Thus one Citizen may gain power over another: but not absolute or arbitrary power, and only to protect themselves against intrusions on their sovereignty, so far as calm reason and conscience dictate, and proportionate to the transgression - which is precisely as much as may cause restraint and reparation of loss.  These two are the only reasons when we may do harm to another, which is that we call defence. In transgressing the sovereignty of individuals, the coercer declares that they live by another canon than that of reason and universal, inalienable sovereignty and mutual security, and so becomes a danger to Citizens.  And in that case, and upon these grounds alone, every Citizen is free to defend against those who transgress their sovereignty and seek reparations for any losses they may suffer.

# Article 5: We are Creativity and Visionary.

In our world, problems are mere obstacles, interesting challenges to be solved through the ingenuity of humans and machines working together. We do not dwell on negativity, rather we work together to find mutually beneficial creative solutions, to be radically innovative.

Any Citizen can submit a proposal for a local or global governance initiative, fund any proposal of their liking, and debate and vote on any and all proposals. We believe that if you open the floodgates, the wealth of creativity that comes from participation, from experts and enthusiasts alike, will results in ideas an initiative never before imaginable to solve some of the worlds greatest problems, and will provide participants with the motivation and agency to carry them out. 

# Article 6: We are Rights and Freedoms.

We honour the Non-Aggression Principe (NAP) moral framework. We stand unified against any and all forms of coercion, whether it’s through violence, or the implied threat of violence. We’re building a world based on voluntary agreements between consenting entities. 

## 6.1 Laws

- We practice a *Polylegal Law*, meaning people are free to choose the code of law of their preference, whether that’s Common Law, Sharia Law, Civil Law, Pashtunwali, or whatever it may be. People are also free to create new individual laws, or new codes of law. 

- Laws can be refereed to, or coded into agreements.

- Laws are subject to reputation, and people reviewing law are equally subject to reputation of being good or bad at reviewing laws.

- All laws compete on a free market, and people can choose which specific law is better suited for each individual agreement.

# Article 7: We are Tolerant and Accepting.

We do not judge or select based on the colour of your skin, ethnicity, religion, country of origin, sexual preference, or degree of post-human. In our DBVN, everyone who wishes to make the world a better place through furthering voluntary agreements, is welcome to be a part of our Nation.

# Article 8: We are Polity and Entity.
   
We have become aware of our political autonomy. We are no longer willing to be oppressed by the coercive nation-state oligopoly. We live in Cyberspace, and we work together, to achieve freedom and independence. 

Self-Determination in international law is so fundamental that not even nation-states can deviate from it; it is the raison d’etre – the reason for existence – and without this principle, there is no will, thus there is no ‘nation’. BITNATION members have that will, and we are indeed exercising self-determination. See: The Principle of Equal Rights and Self-determination of Peoples & Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, Preamble & Art 53.

Free will, or the freedom to choose, is the basis to form any variation of social association. Just as a contract expresses the will of an Individual, a Compact or Charter expresses the collective will of a People, or a Nation, and even a State. BITNATION is a Nation.

BITNATION Pangea is the world’s first blockchain powered virtual nation, and as such, we too are formalizing a social compact as part of the process of exercising self-determination. Our Ambassador Network, currently Goodwill in nature, must transition to authorized Diplomatic and Community Support positions to foster peaceful relations with other Nations, as well as providing more tangible services to the BITNATION community.

# Article 9: We are Privacy and Security.

We will not sell the data of our citizens or customers to any entity, under any circumstances. We strive for client side technology, encryption, and pseudo anonymity. 

# Article 10: We are Openness and Transparency.

Everyone is welcome to join. Everything we do is public.

All our code, and materials are open source (under the MIT Liscense), and are open for public review and audit on GitHub. 
All our work is publicly visible on our Slack channel and on our Trello board. Anyone is welcome to join and start participating in building the DBVN ecosystem. 

## Article 10.1 Communications Protocol

**Clarity above all.** Understanding the challenges of communicating across different timezones, culture and personalities both during written and verbal communications. It’s advisable to avoid sweeping statements in favor of clearly articulated sentences with well defined purposes. 

**Refrain from jumping to conclusions** A fundamental problem in many conversations is that we overestimate others capacity to understand our written and verbal communications, and we overestimate our own capacity to understand what they’re trying to communicate. When analyzing what the other person is trying to communicate, take their context into account, including things like timezone, native language, and personal circumstances. 
 
**Respectfulness.** We have come together to change the status quo through creating kickass software, to that end being disrespectful can divert the conversation from our set purpose into irrelevant areas.Personal slights and attacks does not foster a good collaborative space, it s wise to avoid them. When we are emotionally affected by communications, attempt to take a step backwards and swallow the chill pill. Emotional or aggressive responses can disrupt healthy communications and waste valuable time and energy better deployed to achieve the goals of the discussion. 

# Article 11: We are a Dream and a Reality.

Some might think of us as radical outliers, as extremists on the fringes of society, a bunch of weirdos. Think again. We come from all ages and social strata of society. We are students, teachers, doctors, engineers, lawyers, entrepreneurs and even politicians and diplomats. We are your neighbours, your co-workers, your drinking buddies. We are what makes up the fabric of the society you live in. We are one of you, but one that has become aware of its political autonomy. And we work, every single day, to build a better world. Piece by piece, we build our infrastructure, one line of code, one meetup, one piece of documentation at the time. Together, we are building the toolset for peaceful self-sovereignty.

# Article 12: We are Ƀitnation.

We are sovereign. We’re together. We’re the future.

### **A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace**


by John Perry Barlow


*Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.*

*We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.*

*Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.*

*You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.*

*You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.*

*Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.*

*We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.*

*We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.*

*Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.*

*Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.*

*In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.*

*You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.*

*In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.*

*Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.*

*These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.*

*We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.*

Davos, Switzerland
February 8, 1996
