LICENSE: NO COPYRIGHT MONOPOLY CLAIMED, NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND GIVEN

All code in this solution and its subprojects are IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN,
unless specificially marked otherwise (when it comes from a different
package or commercial source).

Where the concept "public domain" does not exist, the copyright monopoly
license Creative Commons Zero (CC0) is used as a declararation of Public
Domain, or as an alternative, the Unlicense (see below).

This means that anybody may use this code for absolutely anything. The
copyright monopoly does not affect it at all. Any question that begins
with a "but can I" or "but what if", concerning permission to use this
software, is answered with a "yes". More than that: it's a "yes, and
why are you so conditioned to ask permission for using knowledge?"

Anybody submitting new code, imagery, or other components to the project
agrees to put their additions in the public domain. If you're adding a
third party component, do flag it as external.


IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONS are all images and the external libraries found
in the Bin folder of the Site projects, and in External Libraries.
The images are flagged with source in their file name. Do not commit
any new restricted code without prior consensus in the project team.


Another way of putting this is the way of the UNLICENSE:


The BITNATION Constitution is free and unencumbered software released 
irrevocably into the public domain.

Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or
distribute this software, or do anything else with it; in any form,
specifically including source code form, as a compiled binary, or
as an interpretive dance performance; for any purpose, commercial,
nonprofit, hobby, or otherwise; and by any means, specifically
including any means you can think of. You are also free to eat it,
dance with it, or have sex with it. If you figure out that last
option, the project team appreciates if you share the insight.

In jurisdictions that recognize the immoral exclusive rights of
copyright monopoly laws, the author or authors of this software
dedicate any and all copyright monopoly interest in the software
irrevocably to the public domain. We make this dedication for the
benefit of the public at large and for the benefit of our heirs and
successors (albeit explicitly not a "benefit" in the form of an
immoral and destructive right of exclusivity). We intend this
dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of
all present and future rights of exclusivity to this software
under copyright monopoly law.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

THE AUTHORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THIS SOFTWARE WILL PERFORM AS
EXPECTED, PERFORM OTHER THAN EXPECTED, OR PERFORM AT ALL.

IN THE EVENT OF DAMAGES EXCEEDING TEN MILLION US DOLLARS OR CASUALTIES
EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE, THE AFFLICTED USERS AGREE THAT THEY
STOLE THE SOFTWARE WHILE ON VACATION IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND THE
AUTHORS HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT.
