Through time, governments become corrupted. The US government is now completely corrupted. It has become so intolerable that we would be better off without it. Here, we lay down some of the crimes this government has committed in our names:
1. Overthrowing the People of the United States of America: Through bribery (aka lobbying) our representatives serve only the will of those who have the most money, completely disenfranchising 99% of the people they are sworn to represent.

2. Overthrowing the People of Foreign Nations: Through coups, bombings, providing weapons, providing intelligence, and giving money, the US government has directly aided the overthrow of many foreign nations whose leaders would not impose oligarchic hegemony.

3. War Crimes: Blowing up innocent humans(doctors, reporters, babies, etc) with rockets and gunfire launched from aerial drones, bombs from airplanes, helicopters, etc. 

4. Torture.

5. Violations of every right in the bill of rights including: using the military against the People, using militarized police jointly with the military against the People, spying on the People, and using propaganda on the People.

6. Exhonorating murderous police by way of mock trials, and then releasing those same police back into the community to terrorize and murder the People.

7. Genocide

8. Endless, costly, illegal wars for oil barons and bankers.

9. Providing bailouts to failed banks while the People were left to starve, go homeless, lose everything, etc.

10. Endless borrowing of money to the tune of trillions of dollars, knowing that it can never possibly be repaid without forcing every American into indentured servitude for the rest of their lives.

11. Election rigging, ballot rigging, voter exclusion, gerrymandering, and manufacturing consent.

We have written to these representatives many times expressing our views, which usually results in a canned response and no action. We have marched in the streets, where we were brutally repressed. We have engaged in civil disobedience, to no avail. We have appealed to them in every conceivable way. We have tried the courts, the ballots, the vote. We wrote countless articles, books, even university studies. 

We therefore, in the Name, and by the Authority of the good People of America, publish and declare our independence from the Plutocratic United States and dissolve all political connection between us and them.
